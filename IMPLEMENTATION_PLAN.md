## Updated Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework Foundation ‚úÖ
- [x] Set up TypeScript project structure
- [x] Configure development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Jest)
- [x] Create hexagonal architecture folders
- [x] Set up build system and testing
- [x] Initialize Git repository for framework

### Phase 2: Domain Layer & Entities
- [ ] Implement core domain entities (User, Chat, Message, Image, Document, etc.)
- [ ] Define repository interfaces (ports)
- [ ] Create domain service interfaces
- [ ] Implement basic use cases structure

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Adapters

- [ ] Basic API routes and middleware
- [ ] Framework integration and wiring
- [ ] Environment configuration management

### Phase 6: Admin Interface Foundation
- [ ] Next.js setup in `/application/admin`
- [ ] Basic layout and navigation
- [ ] Authentication integration with framework
- [ ] Core UI components and styling

### Phase 7: Admin Configuration Management
- [ ] Environment variable editor
- [ ] Service adapter configuration interfaces
- [ ] Database connection testing
- [ ] API key management and validation
- [ ] Configuration export/import functionality

### Phase 8: Admin Testing Interfaces

## Key Features Integration

### ü§ñ AI Services
- **Framework**: Core AI service interfaces and adapters
- **Application**: API endpoints for AI functionality
- **Admin**: Testing playgrounds and configuration

### üß† RAG Pipeline
- **Framework**: Document processing and vector storage
- **Application**: RAG query endpoints
- **Admin**: RAG testing and debugging interface

### üîê Authentication
- **Framework**: Firebase Auth adapter
- **Application**: Protected routes and user management
- **Admin**: Auth configuration and user administration

### üí≥ Payments
- **Framework**: Stripe adapter and payment processing
- **Application**: Payment endpoints and webhooks
- **Admin**: Payment testing and subscription management

### üìä Data Management
- **Framework**: PostgreSQL and pgvector integration
- **Application**: Data API endpoints
- **Admin**: Database monitoring and management tools

## Git Subtree Strategy

The framework (`packages/ai-framework`) will be:

1. **Developed**: In this repository during initial development
2. **Extracted**: To a separate `ai-framework` repository
3. **Distributed**: Via Git subtree to individual projects
4. **Updated**: Through subtree pull operations

## Admin Interface Benefits

The admin interface provides every AI Framework project with:

- **Unified Management**: Consistent configuration across all projects
- **Testing Capabilities**: Built-in testing for all framework features
- **Monitoring**: Real-time insights into usage and performance
- **Development Tools**: Streamlined development and debugging
- **Documentation**: Interactive API documentation and examples

This ensures that every project using the AI Framework has enterprise-grade management and monitoring capabilities without additional development effort.

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priority**: Begin Phase 2 - Domain Layer implementation with core entities and interfaces.

The foundation is solid, and we're ready to start building the core business logic that will power all AI Framework applications.
